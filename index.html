        <h3>My Projects:</h3>

        <!--project 1-->
        <h3><a href="./movie ranking project/movie ranking.html" draggable="false" >1.Movie Ranking Project</a></h3>
        <p>This marks the genesis of my journey into web development. While I acknowledge that it may not boast the complexity of other websites,<br />
            it symbolizes my initial stride towards success. Constructed merely with basic HTML tags, this website reflects my nascent grasp of web design,<br />
            commenced just two days ago.On this project Focused on showcasing my preferred movies and web series, this project currently features reviews <br />
            of the most captivating web series I've indulged in. Below, I've included sample images to provide a glimpse of this endeavor.</p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="column"  ><img src="./movie ranking project/images/M.png" height="200" width="200" alt="project previwe"  ></div>
            <div class="column"  ><img src="./movie ranking project/images/M1.png"  height="200" width="200" alt="project previwe"  ></div>
            <div class="column"  ><img src="./movie ranking project/images/M2.png" height="200" width="200" alt="project previwe"  ></div>
        </div>
        <p>This movie ranking project differs from other common review websites; it is entirely based on my personal favorite movies and web series list.<br />
            By click on the above titel you are navigated to my favorite movies and web series web page.I am really very exited about my upcomig projects also!!</p>

        <!--Project 2-->
        <h3><a href="./birthday project/birthday.html" draggable="false"> 2.Birthday Invite Project</a></h3>
        <p>Every year, celebrating my birthday involves personally visiting people's homes or meeting them at various locations,<br />
             which can be quite challenging and time-consuming. Then, one day, I had an idea about a "birthday invitation" project.</p>
        <img src="./birthday project/images/B2.png" height="200" alt="Screenshot of project" draggable="false" />
        <p>With this project, I could simply invite everyone using just one link, saving me time and effort. If you'd like to see my invitation,<br />
            go ahead and click on it. This will take you to another website where you'll find my birthday invitation.</p>
